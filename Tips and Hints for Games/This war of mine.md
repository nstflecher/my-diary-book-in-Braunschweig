**GUIDE**: How to survive (Without killing and stealing)
This is a guide on how I basically survive throughout my days in the game. I will not be explaining how to survive if you encounter snow on the 1st day. With this guide you SHOULD be able to make ALL the "right" moral decisions throughout the game.

On the first day: Rummage through the whole house scavenging for any item available. Build a Metal Workshop after acquiring the required materials. Make 1 shovel and 1 crowbar. Have a survivor dig with shovel while others dig with hands.(Tip: The shovel can be used even when your survivor is halfway through digging with hands) The crowbar would then be used to unlock closet or doors. (Tip: Allow your survivors to starve for days until they all turn from hungry to very hungry, only then you allow them to eat---Saves a lot of food). Make two/one beds depending on how many survivors you got. 1 survivor scavenge (The one with highest number of bag capacity) and the rest sleep on bed or floor if materials are not enough. 
(Tip: Focus on scavenging places with least dangers and at the same time have the appropriate materials you would want to get) 
(Tip: Those places with higher warning approach with caution)
(After the first day remember to always have a guard at night and switch roles every night if the survivor is tired/sick/hurt)
(Tip: Remember you can sleep during the day so that the one guarding or scavenging at night can rest/recover from tired/sick/hurt).
SUMMARY: On day one, you should have scavenge anything available in the house. Make a Metal workshop and beds. 

(SPECIAL TIP: If you come across a military guy who is about to ♥♥♥♥ a girl in the supermarket, just open the door, run a few steps behind the soldier, when the soldier look over, the girl will run and you shall run with her.)

Following days: Concentrate on scavenging materials (Primarily wood and components, it is also usually a must to acquire any gears and <electrical parts- obtain only from scavenging>) required to build/upgrade Simple workshop to Improved workshop. 
Remember to also scour for food!
If the area does not have the appropriate materials, set your eyes on items such as bandage,medicine,jewellery,moonshine/alcohol in such order, which you can most probably use for trading if required. 
(Tip: Remember to make use of your character benefits such as Bruno for cooking)

After upgrading the workshop, if possible make a Trap for small animals. On the third day you MUST have a crude stove or even better a upgraded one, as probably your survivors are probably crying/begging for food---(Status: Very Hungry). Cook and eat the food---(Status: Hungry). 
(Tip: Convert wood to fuel only-explanation below)

Make a Rainwater collector or Trap for small animals on the next day. Depending on what items you have obtain, if you have a lot of clean water, you should make the traps, vice versa. Have your 2 traps made ASAP. 
(Tips: If you happen to stumble upon the fertiliser (tomato) use it as bait, never use the canned food as bait)

After this, on any days where you have extra materials. remember to board up the whole damn house. Upgrade the improved workshop and then build a reinforced door. 

Build a upgraded heater/heater if required---either they feel chilly or it has started snowing. (Tip: Always throw in fuel by right clicking on the heater itself, make sure it is above 16°C). 
(Tip: If you are running short of fuel, craft an axe---Explanation below<Luxury Items>)
If none of this have occurred yet, you should probably invest on making a radio. Tuning and playing around with the radio allows you to know what is kinda happening outside. It can warn you of the upcoming snowy weather, shoot-out between the rebels and the military which can lead to places being blocked. It can even tell you when an item barter price has increased (Cigarettes etc). Other benefits from the radio include the use of classical, polish songs to brighten the mood if they are sad)---Wonderful Soundtracks
(Tip: Tune the radio to the spot where the white light appears and stops beeping to view/listen to news/songs)

Luxury Items: Chairs, Armchair---(Tip: Required to build both to satisfy the survivors)
Guitar---(Tip: Played to brighten their mood, should only be played by survivor 
who knows how to play the guitar, if not I suggest you listen to only
the radio)
(Tip: Broken guitar can be found only in places that are locked/Barred)
Books---(Tip: Brighten their mood)
Upgrading Metal WorkShop
Axe---(Tip: Chops furniture for wood, able to be brought along to places to 
chop up furnitures obtaining wood and fuel only)

At the later part of the game after the luxury items (around 30-40 days), focus on obtaining anything for bartering. 
(Tips: Scavenge through all places with no danger at all, make sure it is 90+% searched and acquired)
Since now your sole purpose is to mainly eat, you should focus on bartering for clean water as you would slowly run out on components whereas wood can be easily obtained using an axe. If you ever run low on food. barter.
(Tip: Listen to the radio everyday as it will eventually hint you that the war is coming to an end, before it ends make sure your survivors gets to use all the medicine/bandages to get out from any situation, eat everyday and stay healthy and happy!
So as to obtain a "happy" ending!

Have Fun!!

Strategy for boardgame:
I haven’t seen any in-depth character reviews or strategies yet, so let’s see if we can fix that. This is taking longer to complete than expected, so I’ll cover half here, and the other half in a follow-up post. 

I realize that TWoM is meant to be an experience, and that the designers would prefer that we not try to “game” the game too much by overanalyzing it. I would argue that game mechanics provide characterization, and that pointing out how to play the characters effectively can help people visualize who the survivors are, and how they would react to the world around them. In any event, if you disagree with any points I make, or feel something should be added, feel free to comment below.

I debated whether or not to include background and abilities from Memories here, and in the end there was no contest. No discussion about these characters’ personalities and how to play them seems complete if I don’t include the expansion, I’ve been playing with Memories for so long I’m not even sure I can separate them out. Having said that…I’d recommend not clicking the spoiler windows until you’ve played several games with the expansion if it’s something that interests you. Your first games with Memories are about discovery, learning what the characters are about, and what they can do with the proper motivation. In future games though, after you’ve explored their memories and know what they’re capable of, their triggers effectively become extra abilities and strategizing around them adds replayability. (Also, I’m not providing a complete list of what the memories are, only the ones that I’ve found I actively plan around. For the rest, you’ll have to find them on your own.)

(Note: Yes, I take some liberties regarding characterizations that are not strictly spelled out in the text. Like I said, game mechanics provide characterization too, and I fill in the gaps accordingly.)

Anton: The Self-Loathing Senior

If I have a problem with this game, it’s how it treats the elderly and the academics. The fathers of each of my parents suffered through the Great Depression as children and adolescents, fought in WWII as young men, and worked their way to become a high school teacher and college professor respectively. While neither were in their athletic prime by the time I came on the scene, age and experience tends to bring with it a force of will and determination that in many ways makes up for physical ability. Anton shows little of this, only his emotional collapse at watching civilization evaporate around him.

Gamewise, Anton is a serious drain on the shelter. With no fighting ability you aren’t having him defend the shelter, and his scavenging inventory is nothing special. He has no special ability, and his bad B and C spirits make him very likely to fall into an unavoidable death spiral once he gets wounded, hungry, or ill. His saving grace is his misery is likely to stay low (Spirit A) if you have books on hand, but even this will come at a cost of him being more fatigued than the other characters.

Anton generally ends up as an extra pair of hands when scavenging, and the person that negative states get dumped on when things get tough. 

Anton’s Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
Anton’s memories don’t make him any better. In fact, his ratio of helpful to harmful memories is almost even. Not only that, pretty much any useful memory he has will require giving up his card. You will almost always have a better choice of person to use a memory trigger any given day. The main exception is when it gets cold…being able to sacrifice Anton to help save another character is cold-hearted, but can be a literal life-saver for a critical team member if you’re willing to pay the price.


Arica: Your Average Street Punk

Arica has lived a tough life. Abused or ignored by authority figures, she made a family as best she could among local petty criminals. After they fell one by one in the chaos of the war she fell in with our shelter. Personality-wise, she’s a little inconsistent: she has no use for mewling citizens who can’t protect their own property, but isn’t as willing as, say, Emilia to use violence to get what she wants. 

Arica is probably my least favorite Red character. (Which is disappointing given how bad-ass she was in the computer version.) The 2 prowess is functional, but a 3 inventory isn’t great. Being able to reset the noise can be helpful, but it also leads you into a false sense of security. (There were several times I carelessly allowed to noise to rise, planning to reset it when I hit 5, only to find a resident at noise 3-4.) The lockpick reroll is nice, but I usually trade them when I play so it’s not that great.

Where she really falls down is in her spirits. She is the only character who will gain 2 misery if her cigarette addiction isn’t met, and with it being spirit A it’s going to come up a lot. Building an herbal garden is almost mandatory, or at the very least don’t let the cigarette supply run out. (And pray for there being no rats.) Her guitar skills are ok, but I wouldn’t go trading a lot to get one.

Arica tends to be my shelter guard in the early game, her high prowess can keep the early raiders out somewhat. By night 4 it’s usually time to swap her out and have her scavenge…you should have at least one board up and weapon by that point, and her stealth becomes important to avoid the nastier residents. Other than that, keep a supply of cigarettes on hand and don’t let her Misery get above 1.

Arica Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
Arica has no harmful memories, but her helpful memories are all pretty weak. Also, with one exception, every helpful memory will require her to give up her card. I find it particularly cruel that, at misery 3, it only lowers her misery 1 and forfeits her card…that still leaves her at misery 2 which is just one missed cigarette away from fatal despair. I tend to use her card to keep her misery below 2, or as an emergency silencer if noise spikes after she’s already used her normal ability.


Bruno: The Pampered Chef

Bruno is fairly average. His prowess is solid for a non-red, average inventory…He’s functional for either scavenging or guarding. His special ability seems like it should be good, but I just have bad luck with it. (Out of 5 tries, I have gotten exactly 1 vegetable. I don’t waste actions trying anymore.) Also, his empathy is practically non-existent. If you need to steal someone’s last can of beans, Bruno’s your guy.

The fact that cruelty doesn’t seem to faze Bruno is weird seeing as everything else seems to send him crying in a corner. Every spirit option has the possibility of raising his misery, so get used to doing everything you can to keep him uninjured, fed, and smoking or misery will start to become a problem.

In the end, Bruno typically fills whatever role I don’t have a specialist for. Decent at scavenging, decent at guarding, just keep an eye on his misery.

Bruno’s Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
Bruno’s memory responses are where it really becomes clear what a pathetic ass this guy is. Every paragraph of flavor text really makes him unlikeable. Worse, several of his memories’ effects will hurt the shelter or other characters to give him a benefit.

The two memories you really want to pay attention to are building the (upgraded) cooking stove and collecting over 4 food. Both forfeit his card, but have nice effects in return. In particular, the feast he prepares given enough food will drop EVERYONE’S hunger and misery, which can be huge. (The misery loss from the stove is less grand, but if he needs it it can be a lifesaver.)


Boris: The Fragile Forklift

Boris has lived a hard life. His job performing manual labor worked him to the bone, his only solace was spending time with his wife and son. Their deaths in the war broke him. He’s adopted the other survivors in the shelter as his new family to take care of, but his mental scars run deep.

Boris is incredibly useful to the team. He is a capable fighter, but you will never keep him at home guarding because of his (frankly) overpowered carrying capacity. Bruno’s 6 inventory is double what most characters can carry, and you will exploit that ruthlessly if you want the shelter to survive. He doesn’t have a special ability, he doesn’t need one. He’s good enough as he is.

The thing that keeps him from being completely overpowered is his deep seated emotional trauma. If Boris doesn’t stay well rested or runs out of cigarettes his misery will become an issue. His spirit C wound healing ability doesn’t happen often, but it’s a nice surprise when it does.

Boris will be your workhorse hauling whatever you need home each night. Only keep him back guarding if the radio gave you a very good reason for it. And for goodness sakes, build a bed and make sure he uses it each morning.

Boris’s Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
Remember that deep-seated emotional trauma I mentioned earlier…well his memories are where they really come to a crisis. Every useful memory he has will make his misery rise, and in spite of this you will use them over and over and over. In games where Boris is one of my characters, I will use one of his memories every day unless I have a clear reason to save my daily memory for someone else. Accidentally driving Boris to insanity with them is a serious problem. They are that good. It doesn’t help that none of his memories cause him to lose his card, so the temptations are always there until they kill him. (Again, his crippling depression is what keeps him from being overpowered. It’s way too easy to accidentally work him to death, and it’s painful knowing that (unlike so many things that can go wrong in this war) it was totally preventable…and definitely your fault.) 

The primary memories that get used are the ones that increase his misery by 1 to raise his inventory by 5. Think on that a moment. For one misery, he now is able to carry 11 weight. That’s almost as much as 4 regular characters, and twice what even Marko can carry. You will have all the wood, components, and water you desire, and will rarely need to leave anything behind.

The other is somewhat situational, but equally powerful. If Boris spends an action crafting something in the workshop and gains 1 misery he gains 2 additional day actions after the 3rd actions of the day are done, regardless of how many black dots his statuses give him. Given how most characters usually have enough status tokens to limit them to two actions, it’s like having an additional character to work around the shelter, but he still only eats like a single person.

Both of these abilities are fantastic, but I can’t stress enough how important it becomes to manage his misery. It is way too easy to let his misery rise too high to the point where one missed cigarette and/or bad event can pull him up to 4. You will want to build a chair early, collect lots of books, and keep a supply of emergency moonshine on hand at all times. (though again, watch that fatigue too…)


Cveta: Another Mouth to Feed

Again with an elderly educator feeling sorry for herself, with no relevant skills for the current crisis. (What kinds of instructors did the game designers have growing up?) Cveta shows a little more mental fortitude than Anton towards her desire to not let down the young people in the shelter, but this is countered by a complete lack of any useful abilities.

If Cveta is one of your starting characters, you’ve been drafted into playing on hard mode. With a 0 Prowess she’s useless in a fight or guarding the shelter, and her 2 inventory makes her a poor choice to go scavenging. She has no special abilities, a coffee addiction, and an empathy so high that her Misery level is likely to fluctuate all over the place. (Every event, good or bad, is likely to change her Misery.)

Place her in whatever job is least critical at night. Truth be told, she makes a great candidate for “sleep in a bed / on the floor”, then she may be available for 3 day actions the next morning. (Poking about or searching heaps will more than make up for the 2 inventory she would have been worth scavenging.)

Cveta’s Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
Cveta isn’t exactly redeemed by her memories, but they go a long way towards making her a contributing member of the shelter. With one glaring exception, her memories tend to provide useful benefits with minimal drawbacks. 

The two that are most useful come at the beginning and end of her story. Inviting her to join the shelter lowers two characters' Misery; this plus the equipment she brings is usually well worth welcoming her in despite her drawbacks. Then, should things get dire and you stop feeding her, she will quietly pass during the night without making the other members roll for misery. Again, neither make her a great character, but with them she is able to help in her own way.


Emilia: Pretty Little Psycho

Emilia had everything: A family that loved her, a position she worked hard for, and a life of luxury. That’s all gone now, and someone’s gonna pay…

Basic game Emilia is fairly average in most respects. Prowess 1 is functional, and a 3 inventory is pretty standard. Her spirits are both negative: a coffee addiction along with an intense aversion to cold, but her empathy is low enough that outside events are unlikely to faze her.

Her Diary ability is very handy, every morning she can drop her misery by any amount by raising her fatigue by the same amount. I don’t know where she found her never-ending flask of vodka, but she needs to learn to share.  

While she is equally functional at scavenging as guarding, I tend to prefer having her in the scavenging party. With her heartless attitude she is less likely to have any reservations about providing for the shelter at other people’s expense, and if anything traumatic does happen…with her diary she’ll recover faster than anyone else.

Emilia’s Memories:

Spoiler (click to reveal)
War changes people. In our band of survivors the changes vary widely. Losing his family turned Boris into a broken shell of a man, living only to provide for the people he has left. Bruno fell from his perch of fame to become a pathetic wretch whining in a corner. Roman looked in the mirror, recoiled at what he had become, and left everything he knew for a chance at redemption. By contrast, one of our survivors after losing a life of privilege looked out at the cruel world around her, fed off of the darkness, and is ready to vent her malice back at her tormenters twice over, along with anyone who gets in her way: Our shelter’s resident monster…Emilia.

Emilia with Memories can be downright terrifying.

At the cost of a little sanity, she can accomplish many things. For 1 misery, she can swindle a family out of everything they own. For 1 Misery, she can let her rage flow through her and become as deadly in combat as Roman, or with a little more effort she can stare her attackers down and convince them they really don’t want to set her off. For 1 Misery she can straight up murder someone as an automatic instant kill backstab. Through it all she remains calm, all it takes is documenting her deeds in her serial killer scrapbook journal in the morning and taking a nap and last night will be nothing more to her than a pleasant evening stroll. (You do need to take care she doesn’t hit 4 Misery first, but that’s not too difficult with a little forethought.)

You aren’t likely to be triggering her every day, but if you have a hunch that something big is going down tonight, it’s a good idea to save a memory trigger for her.

Emilia is a monster, but she’s our monster. Sleep tight…
