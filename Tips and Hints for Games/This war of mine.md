**GUIDE**: How to survive (Without killing and stealing)
This is a guide on how I basically survive throughout my days in the game. I will not be explaining how to survive if you encounter snow on the 1st day. With this guide you SHOULD be able to make ALL the "right" moral decisions throughout the game.

On the first day: Rummage through the whole house scavenging for any item available. Build a Metal Workshop after acquiring the required materials. Make 1 shovel and 1 crowbar. Have a survivor dig with shovel while others dig with hands.(Tip: The shovel can be used even when your survivor is halfway through digging with hands) The crowbar would then be used to unlock closet or doors. (Tip: Allow your survivors to starve for days until they all turn from hungry to very hungry, only then you allow them to eat---Saves a lot of food). Make two/one beds depending on how many survivors you got. 1 survivor scavenge (The one with highest number of bag capacity) and the rest sleep on bed or floor if materials are not enough. 
(Tip: Focus on scavenging places with least dangers and at the same time have the appropriate materials you would want to get) 
(Tip: Those places with higher warning approach with caution)
(After the first day remember to always have a guard at night and switch roles every night if the survivor is tired/sick/hurt)
(Tip: Remember you can sleep during the day so that the one guarding or scavenging at night can rest/recover from tired/sick/hurt).
SUMMARY: On day one, you should have scavenge anything available in the house. Make a Metal workshop and beds. 

(SPECIAL TIP: If you come across a military guy who is about to ♥♥♥♥ a girl in the supermarket, just open the door, run a few steps behind the soldier, when the soldier look over, the girl will run and you shall run with her.)

Following days: Concentrate on scavenging materials (Primarily wood and components, it is also usually a must to acquire any gears and <electrical parts- obtain only from scavenging>) required to build/upgrade Simple workshop to Improved workshop. 
Remember to also scour for food!
If the area does not have the appropriate materials, set your eyes on items such as bandage,medicine,jewellery,moonshine/alcohol in such order, which you can most probably use for trading if required. 
(Tip: Remember to make use of your character benefits such as Bruno for cooking)

After upgrading the workshop, if possible make a Trap for small animals. On the third day you MUST have a crude stove or even better a upgraded one, as probably your survivors are probably crying/begging for food---(Status: Very Hungry). Cook and eat the food---(Status: Hungry). 
(Tip: Convert wood to fuel only-explanation below)

Make a Rainwater collector or Trap for small animals on the next day. Depending on what items you have obtain, if you have a lot of clean water, you should make the traps, vice versa. Have your 2 traps made ASAP. 
(Tips: If you happen to stumble upon the fertiliser (tomato) use it as bait, never use the canned food as bait)

After this, on any days where you have extra materials. remember to board up the whole damn house. Upgrade the improved workshop and then build a reinforced door. 

Build a upgraded heater/heater if required---either they feel chilly or it has started snowing. (Tip: Always throw in fuel by right clicking on the heater itself, make sure it is above 16°C). 
(Tip: If you are running short of fuel, craft an axe---Explanation below<Luxury Items>)
If none of this have occurred yet, you should probably invest on making a radio. Tuning and playing around with the radio allows you to know what is kinda happening outside. It can warn you of the upcoming snowy weather, shoot-out between the rebels and the military which can lead to places being blocked. It can even tell you when an item barter price has increased (Cigarettes etc). Other benefits from the radio include the use of classical, polish songs to brighten the mood if they are sad)---Wonderful Soundtracks
(Tip: Tune the radio to the spot where the white light appears and stops beeping to view/listen to news/songs)

Luxury Items: Chairs, Armchair---(Tip: Required to build both to satisfy the survivors)
Guitar---(Tip: Played to brighten their mood, should only be played by survivor 
who knows how to play the guitar, if not I suggest you listen to only
the radio)
(Tip: Broken guitar can be found only in places that are locked/Barred)
Books---(Tip: Brighten their mood)
Upgrading Metal WorkShop
Axe---(Tip: Chops furniture for wood, able to be brought along to places to 
chop up furnitures obtaining wood and fuel only)

At the later part of the game after the luxury items (around 30-40 days), focus on obtaining anything for bartering. 
(Tips: Scavenge through all places with no danger at all, make sure it is 90+% searched and acquired)
Since now your sole purpose is to mainly eat, you should focus on bartering for clean water as you would slowly run out on components whereas wood can be easily obtained using an axe. If you ever run low on food. barter.
(Tip: Listen to the radio everyday as it will eventually hint you that the war is coming to an end, before it ends make sure your survivors gets to use all the medicine/bandages to get out from any situation, eat everyday and stay healthy and happy!
So as to obtain a "happy" ending!

Have Fun!!
