*15 tiny *action* details that might be neglected in the Last of us*:
1. sneaky ellie 
when you enter the toy shop with Henry and Sam, henry will scold Sam for taking a toy. After Sam has put the toy back, ellie will steal the toy and give it to Sam later on in the story. Ellie will only take the toy when you aren't looking.
2. you heard it here first
a newspaper can be found with a headline referring to an 'uncharted 13' movie. It also says that nathan drake will be played by justin bieber.
3. the writings on the wall
towards the end of the game, you will find yourself in an abandoned hospital. One of the eye test charts on the wall says 'run you a nearly there don't quit!'
4. bullets to spare
if you waste ammo, ellie will ask if you have bullets to spare.
5. can't seem to catch a break
when you break david's finger in a cutscene, he will actually wear a splint on the broken finger in a later cutscene. This is something that could have easily been overlooked.
6. you are my flashlight
another samll detail that you have probably seen a hundred times is the fact that NPC's will visibly flinch when your shine you shine your flashlight on them.
7. made you flinch!
when walking through the market area at the beginning of the game, you can find a child holding a giraffe. If you walk close to her she will shield the giraffe from 
8. I would be scared of joel too

9. so, what's the plan?
wait a long time, will activate this words by ellie.
10. Baby, it's cold outside
11. Miss you too
when looking through your backpack when playing as ellie, if you inspect *riley's firefly* pendant ellie will play 'Miss You'.
12. apocalyptic snowman
when joel stands in the snow, it will begin to cover his jacket and hair. If you head inside, the snow will melt.

feeling:这让我想起了这款游戏的电视预告：一个玩家，不停的玩不停的玩，在最后，他变成了主角乔尔，愤而起身保护艾莉。我，就是这种感觉。我变成了乔尔，我救出了艾莉，我关心她，我保护她，且，我做到了。
